# odin-recipes
This is my first project from the TOP
I'll build a basic recipe website in the HTML

This project was quite fun and felt easy. Tbh I had more issue with the reciepe text than the code itself. It was helpful for practice and I do like using the terminal for the navigation. It seems easier! :D
